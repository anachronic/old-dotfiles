# dotfiles

This is a collection of some dot files i have recently been in need to
mantain over multiple machines. Here's a complete full story just
because I can:

So I recently discovered [i3wm](http://i3wm.org/). It's just the kind
of thing I was looking for, because since I started to make heavy use
of Emacs, I've been using the mouse less and less everyday. This
project is a really good solution to that, but it has it's drawbacks:
You kind of have to do everything by yourself. Which is, you know,
good when your're learning but not too good when you have to get the
job done quickly.

Hence, this repository.

## What should I put here?

Just non-emacs stuff:

1. `urxvt` config
2. `i3` config
3. Maybe my (very poor) vim config
4. `.Xmodmap` file.

As you can see, most of the files in this repository are intended to
be used for some sort of development environment. I mostly use Arch
Linux.
